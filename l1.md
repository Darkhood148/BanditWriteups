# Level 1
First we connect to the server using `ssh` as in previous level<br/>
There is a file named `-`<br/>
We cannot use `cat -` so instead we use file path in cat command.<br/>
---
Commands-
---
`ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
---
`ls`
---
`cat ./-`
Since `./-` is a file path, cat command displays the contents of the file at the path
