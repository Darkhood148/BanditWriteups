# Level 7
First we connect to the server using `ssh`<br/>
Then we use `grep` to highlight the line with the word "millionth" in it.
---
Commands-
---
`ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
---
`cat data.txt | grep "millionth"`<br/>
`|` operator sends the output of the first command as input for the second command.<br/>
Thus, the cat or the text of the file becomes input for `grep`.<br/>
`grep` then searches for the word millionth and prints the line containg it and our password.
