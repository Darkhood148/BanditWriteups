# Level 5
First we connect to the server using `ssh`<br/>
Inside the inhere directory there are many folders. We use `find` command to get the required file according to the given parameters<br/>
---
Commands-
---
`ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
---
`cd inhere`
---
`find . -readable -size 1033c ! -executable`<br/>
find is used to find single or multiple files satisfying some given conditions.<br/>
`.` tells find to begin the search from the current directory<br/>
`-readable` tells find that the file should be readable by the current user.<br/>
`-size 1033c` tells find that the file size should be 1033 bytes.<br/>
`! -executable` tells find that the file is not an executable.<br/>
On running the command we get output as<br/>
`./maybehere07/.file2`<br/>
So our next step is...
---
`cat ./maybehere07/.file2`
