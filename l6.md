# Level 6
Very similar to previous level.<br/>
Since file is anywhere on the server. We go to the top of the hierarchy tree and use the find command.<br/>
---
Commands-
---
`ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
---
`cd ..` x2
---
`find -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6`<br/>
`-user` specifies of user owner of the file<br/>
`-group` specifies the group owner of the file<br/>
Out of many of the outputted lines on reads..<br/>
`./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password`<br/>
So our next step is...
---
`cat ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password`
