ssh command connects to the server<br/>
We set up a server side listener using nc at some port which sends current password on connection<br/>
Then we log in using another terminal and use suconnect command to establish connection to the same port<br/>

Commands-
---
`ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`<br/>
`echo "VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT" | nc -l -p 10000`
This command creates server side listener that sends the current password to the connector once connection is established
---
On another terminal<br/>
`ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`<br/>
`./suconnect 10000`<br/>
This gives us the flag
