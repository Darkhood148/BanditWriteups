# Level 4
First we connect to the server using `ssh`<br/>
Go inside `inhere` directory<br/>
Use `file` command to get file-type of all the files in the directory and print the appropriate one.
---
Commands-
---
`ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
---
`cd inhere`
---
`file ./*`<br/>
`*` is used to get all the files in the current directory.<br/>
We find that only `-file07` is of `ASCII text`<br/>
So next we do...
---
`cat ./-file07`
