# Level 1
First we connect to the server using `ssh` as in previous level<br/>
Then we use `bandit20-do` to execute commands as `bandit20` and access the flag<br/>
---
Commands-
---
`ssh bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
---
`./bandit20-do`<br/>
From output we can see that it is used to execute commands as another user (bandit20)
We know the directory of the flag so we simply do...
---
`cat /etc/bandit_pass/*`
---
**Flag - VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT**
