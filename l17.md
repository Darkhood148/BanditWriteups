# Level 17
First we connect to the server using `ssh`<br/>
Then we use `sort` and `uniq` commands to get the changed lines in both the files<br/>
---
Commands-
---
`ssh bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
---
`cat passwords.old passwords.new | sort | uniq -u`<br/>
`cat passwords.old passwords.new` prints the data of both the files in the given order<br/>
`sort` sorts it<br/>
`uniq -u` displays only the unique lines. Since one line is changed there are two output lines.<br/>
One from `passwords.old`, other from `passwords.new`.<br/>
Since we require the one from `passwords.new`, the second line is our flag<br/>
